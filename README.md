# familyfeud
Family feud game in javascript and html. The game interface taken from https://codepen.io/MacEvelly/pen/rLWeYP, just admin panel implemented to seperate game operations from audience.


This game was used for a student organization event in a university. The main interface, the front-end seen by audience is taken from online, and an admin panel created to steer the game from the regie. It was urgent, and there is nothing organized in the code, so sorry.

Questions are fetch from "../js/FF3.json" file.
